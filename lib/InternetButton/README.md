# Internet Button
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/particle-iot/InternetButton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/particle-iot/InternetButton)

_The Internet Button has a lot of features, but some of these aren't as straightforward to use as simple LEDs and sensors. This library abstracts a lot of the complexity and provides simple functions with broad capability. It wraps modified versions of both Adafruit's Neopixel and AnneM's ADXL362 Arduino libraries, as well as some novel functions._

## Examples

1. __Blink an LED__ - How to control the smart LEDs on this board
2. __Blink all the LEDs__ - An extension on the simplest case
3. __LEDs and Buttons__ - How to read the buttons on the Button, and make LEDs blink with them
4. __Good Combination__ - A set of button and LED conditionals that I happen to like and use frequently
5. __Motion__ - The Internet Button also has an accelerometer on it to measure motion- this shows how the related functions work
6. __Orientation__ - How to use the accelerometer functions to determine the orientation
7. __Internet__ - Send that data out to the world!
8. __Making Music__ - Learn how to play notes and songs while controlling LEDs and reading buttons at the same time.
9. __Release Firmware__ - Big, complicated set of epic.


_Watch for gauge and other display additions to this library!_
